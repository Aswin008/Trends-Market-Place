Click data stream using azure services

This Project is intended to build an end to end pipeline to stream the clickstream data to microsoft event hub and then from there to visualise in Power BI Dashboard.
We would be ingesting the data into azure services like cosmos DB.

Simulation script would simulate the click stream data and ingest into the event hub created in Azure.
Event Hub also configured to captured the data, meaning the data will be ingested as avro files in the services.
